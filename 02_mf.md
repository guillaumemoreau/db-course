# Functional modeling

### Before starting

- There exists several model types
  - Entity-Association model
  - UML model
  - SysML model
  - ...
- We cannot study all of them

## Entity-Association Model

### The Entity-Relationship model

- Was created around 1975
  - In France by Tardieu
  - In the US by Chen
- It integrates Merise (modelling method)

### The Entity-Relationship model

- Goal: allow the design/description of the conceptual structure of data for an application
- The base principals are equivalent to real-life abstraction concepts
  - object vs entity
  - link vs relationship
  - property vs attribute
  - representation of multiple links: link *is-a*

### The Entity-Relationship model

  Entity

  - Either a concrete or abstract  object
  - Exists as an instance of itself
  - Is of interest for the information system
  - Needs to be managed

### Entity

  - Entity: it represents an object of the real world having a life of its own
  - Entity Type: representation of a set of entities perceived as similar and having the same characteristics

  \center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/entity.png}

### Entity: properties

  - Must define at least 1 characteristic of the entity that it depends on
  - It is needed for use in the information systems
  - Elementary data
  - It needs to be managed
  - Has a definite domain: {possible values}
  - Some properties may be impossible to define
  - Occurences
    - of properties
    - of entities

### Entity: properties

Properties: the characteristics of an entity

\center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/book.png}

### Properties

- Simple (atomic)
  - cannot be decomposed
  - examples: day, first name
- Domain: atomic values
  - day: belongs to $\{ 1, 2, ... , 31 \}
  - predefined sets, intervals, enumerations

### Properties

- Complex (can be decomposed into other properties)
- to avoid and decompose into simpler elements
- examples
  - address
  - dates (can be an exception)
- A complex property does not have a proper value (no directly associated domain)
  - its value is the composition of the values of the component properties
- A component of a complex property can also be a complex property and this decomposed

### Properties

- **single value**: one value per occurrence (max cardinality = 1)
  - example: StudentID, Licence number, degree name
- **multiple value**: several values per occurrence (max cardinality >1)
  - Avoid!
  - examples: first names, phone numbers
  - the value of a multiple value property is a set (or a list or a multiset) of values, each of which belongs to the domain associated with the property

### Properties

- **mandatory**: at least one value per occurrence (min cardinality >= 1)
  - example: names
- **optional**: may not have a value (min cardinality = 0)
- Whether a value is mandatory or optional is determined by the applications needs
  - if we accept to register someone without knowing his/her birthdate, then the *birthdate* property will be optional (otherwise mandatory)
  - Think about the consequences!


### Occurences

- Occurrence
  - for a property
    - pair (property , its value)
  - for an entity
    - pair (entity , { occurrences of properties } )
- Population { occurrences of entities}

### Example

Entity  |  Property |  Occurrences
--|---|--
Book  | Number  |  15
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  124
  $\,$ | Title  |  Relational Databases
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  The grapes of Wrath
  $\,$ | Author  |  Delobel
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  Steinbeck
  $\,$ | Year  | 1992
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  1939

### Representation

- Textual:
  - name_of_the_entity( list_of_properties )
    - where list_of_properties is a comma-seperated list of properties
- Graphically:

\center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/ER-entity.png}

### Example

Book (Number, Title, Author, Year_Published)

\center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/ER-book.png}

### Entities versus occurrences

\center\includegraphics[height=5cm]{fig/ea-example.pdf}


### Choosing the properties of an entity

- A property is directly linked to the entity it belongs to
- A property cannot evolve under the influence of time (i.e. choose birth date rather than age)
- Avoid property introducing information redundancy

### Relationship

- Semantic link among a set of entities
- Non-directional link
- Is of interest for the information system
- Needs to be managed
- Examples
  - has-written between Author and Book
  - has-published between Publisher and Book
  - has-borrowed between a Book, a Reader and a Date  

### Remarks

- A relationship **always** occurs between entities
- A relationship can **never** occur between relationships
- An entity is **never** directly related to another entity

### Representation

- Textual:
  - relationship_name = < entity_1, ...,  entity_n >
- Graphically:

\center\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{fig/ER-relationship.png}

### Mapping - association

- Mapping: represents a non oriented link between several entities (which play a predetermined part)
- Mapping type: represents a set of mappings having the same semantics et described by the same characteristics

\center\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{fig/mapping-1.pdf}

### Definitions

- **Collection**: set of entities involved in the mapping
- **Dimension**: number of entities involved in the mapping

### Properties of a relationship

The design of the model sometimes imposes some properties to the relationships

\center\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{fig/ER-relationship2.png}

### Relationships types

- Binary

\center\includegraphics[height=2.6cm]{fig/ER-relationship.png}

### Relationships types

- Ternary

\center\includegraphics[height=5cm]{fig/ER-relationship3.png}

### Ternary mapping

\center\includegraphics[height=3cm]{fig/ER-map3.pdf}

### Relationships types

- Hierarchical / Transitive

\center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/ER-relationshiph.png}

### Relationships types

- Symmetrical / Cyclic

\center\includegraphics[height=2.9cm]{fig/ER-relationships.png}

### Symmetrical mapping

\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-sym.pdf}

### Symmetrical mapping (continued)

\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-sym2.pdf}

- Issue: how to know in a couple who is who?

### Symmetrical mapping (continued)

- Solution: specify the role of each entity to solve ambiguities
- 1 "is\_married\_to" = <1 Person/Wife, 1 Person/Husband>

\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-sym3.pdf}

### Cardinalities

\center\includegraphics[height=5cm]{fig/cardinalities.png}

### Cardinalities

\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c1.pdf}

- Two questions raised (per link)
  - How many cars minimum may someone have?
  - How many cars maximum may someone have?

  \center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c2.pdf}

### Cardinality

- defined on the link between an entity and a relationship
  - minimum number of connections: 0 or 1
  - maximum number of connections: 1 or n
- Possible values
  - 0:1
  - 0:n
  - 1:1
  - 1:n

### Example 1

- An order is placed by only one client
- A client can place no order at all or can place multiple orders
- details
  - It is compulsory that an order is placed, min = 1
  - An order is linked to only 1 client, max = 1
  - A client can place no order at all, min = 0
  - A client can place multiple orders, max = n

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/client-order.png}

### Example 2

- A person may not own a car or have 1 or several car

\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c3.pdf}

- A car has one and only one owner

\center\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c4.pdf}

### Cardinalities at large

- **0:1** The entity can be linked to a maximum of 1 other...
- **0:n** The entity can be linked to more than 1 other...
- **1:1** The entity can be linked to only 1 other...
- **1:n** The entity can be linked to at least 1 other...

### Identifiers

- Definition: A minimum set of properties whereby there is no other occurrence in the entity where that values of the properties are the same.
- All entities must have an identifier
- The identifier of an entity is shown by underlining the properties forming part of the identifier

### Other notations

\center\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c5.pdf}

### Other notations

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/mapping-c6.pdf}

### Identifier

*Person(\underline{Number},LastName,FirstName,BirthDate)*

The identifier is composed of a unique attribute

\center\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{fig/person-1.pdf}

### Identifier

*Person(Number,\underline{LastName},\underline{FirstName},BirthDate)*

The identifier is composed of a set of attributes

\center\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{fig/person-2.pdf}

### Identifiers for mappings

The set of linked entities

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/mapping-id.pdf}

Identifier for *HasGrade*: (Student.StudentId + Course.CourseId)

### Identifier for mappings

The set of linked entities

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/mapping-id2.pdf}

\begin{alertblock}{Error}
A customer must be able to order several times the same product
\end{alertblock}

### Identifier for mappings

Solution: transform the mapping into a relation

## How to model?

### Functional dependency

- Definition
  - There exists a **functional dependency** (FD) denoted by $X \rightarrow Y$ if and only if to a same value of $X$ always corresponds the same value of $Y$
  - i.e.
    - $X$ determines $Y$
    - $Y$ depends on $X$

### Functional dependencies

- Between properties
  - knowing one occurrence of the source property, one and only one occurrence of the target property is known
  - notation: $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$
- Between entities
  - knowing one occurrence of the source entity, one and only one occurrence of the target entity is known
  - notation: $Order \rightarrow Customer$

### Entities and mappings

When the source part of the FD has only one entity, the segment between the entity and the mapping has a cardinality (0,1) or (1,1)

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/df-1.pdf}

### Properties of functional dependencies

- Reflexivity
  - $X \rightarrow X$
  - $CustomerId \rightarrow CustomerId$
- Augmentation
  - If $X \rightarrow Y$, then $\forall Z, XZ \rightarrow Y$
  - If $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ then $OrderId,CustomerName \rightarrow CustomerId$
- Transitivity
  - if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$ then $X \rightarrow Z$
  - if $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ and $CustomerId \rightarrow CustomerCompanyId$ then $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerCompanyId$

### Properties of functional dependencies

- Pseudo-Transitivity
  - if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $YZ \rightarrow W$ then $XZ \rightarrow W$
  - if $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ and $CustomerId,City \rightarrow CompanyId$ then $OrderId,City \rightarrow CompanyId$
- Union
  - if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$ then $X \rightarrow YZ$
  - if $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ and $OrderId \rightarrow OrderDate$ then $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId,OrderDate$

### Properties of functional dependencies

- Decomposition
  - if $X \rightarrow YZ$ then $X \rightarrow Y$ and $X \rightarrow Z$
- Example
  - $OrderId \rightarrow OrderDate,CustomerId$ then
    - $OrderId \rightarrow OrderDate$
    - $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$

### Elementary functional dependency

- Definition: $X \rightarrow Y$ is an **elementary functional dependency ** if and only if there is no $Z$ included in X such that $Z \rightarrow Y$
- Examples
  - $OrderId,ArticleId \rightarrow Quantity$ is elementary
  - $OrderId,ArticleId,CustomerId \rightarrow Quantity$ is not elementary

### Direct functional dependency

- Definition: $X \rightarrow Y$ is a **direct functional dependency** if there is no $Z$ such as $X \rightarrow Z$ and $Z \rightarrow Y$
- Examples
  - $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ is direct
  - $ORderId \rightarrow CompanyId$ is not direct because $OrderId \rightarrow CustomerId$ and $CustomerId \rightarrow CompanyId$

### Dependencies graph

- Definition: The **dependencies graph** is the graph representing the $E$ set of elementary functional dependencies for which:
  - the vertices are the attributes
  - the edges are the functional dependencies

### Example

- Set of attributes: $\left\{ Exam, Room, PersonInCharge, Time, Student, Grade \right\}$
- Functional dependencies
  - $Exam \rightarrow PersonInCharge$
  - $Time,Room \rightarrow Exam$
  - $Time,PersonInCharge \rightarrow Room$
  - $Exam,Student \rightarrow Grade$
  - $Time,Student \rightarrow Room$


### Dependency graph

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/depgraph.pdf}

### Transitive closure

- Definition: The **transitive closure** of the dependency graph is the set of all functional dependencies obtained by transitivity on the functional dependencies

### Example

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/depgraph-2.pdf}

### Example

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/depgraph-3.pdf}

### Minimal coverage

- Definition: The **minimal coverage** of $E$ is the set of elementary functional dependencies that has the same transitive closure as a $E$ and such that this property is not true anymore if any functional dependency is removed
- maths: if we define a mapping *has-same-transitive-closure*, it will be an equivalence and thus has equivalences classes which have minimal members

### Example

Here, no single dependency can be removed without altering the transitive closure. It is thus a minimal coverage.

\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/depgraph-2.pdf}

### Properties

- All sets of elementary functional dependencies has at least one minimal coverage
- All direct FD belongs to the minimal coverage
- Every FD belonging to the minimal coverage is direct
