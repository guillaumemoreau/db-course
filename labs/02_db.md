# Objectives

- Use a database administration software
- Query a database
  - to create/update/read data
  - to create tables


# Context

You belong to the *Merigold* company, a logistics company specialized in fruits and vegetables delivery. Your company has a fleet of trucks deployed on the French roads depending on the deliveries schedules.

Every delivery is mapped to an order placed by another company and must be delivered at a given date and time in one of the warehouse of the company which has placed the order. Indeed a given company may have several warehouses. An order itself can include several products. They will be grouped onto palettes to simplify the driver's work.

An example of an order for Vegans Ltd is given below:

Product  | Quantity  | Delivery due date  | Delivery place  
--|---|---|--
Watermelons  | 300kg  | 2019/11/15 14:00  | 5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau
Potatoes  | 1000kg  |  2019/11/15 14:00 |  5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau
Strawberries  | 100kg  | 2019/11/15 16:30  | 8 rue des marchands, Bayonne

When a driver hits the road with his/her truck, he has a mission order which indicates the deliveries to be made along with their dates and times. A delivery for a company always takes place at a warehouse.

Loading is performed on loading docks belonging to Merigold company. Seven of them exist in France, they are strategically located in the whole country. Of course, the aforementioned mission order contains the loading dock as well as the loading date and time.

An example of mission order for driver DENT Arthur would look like this:

Loading: 5 allée Beltégueuse, Soumoulou, 2019/11/14 18:00

Company  | Warehouse  | Date  | Product | Quantity  
--|---|---|---|
Vegans Ltd  | 5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau  |  2019/11/15 14:00  |  Watermelons | 300kg
SunnyCorp  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne  | 2019/11/16 8:00  | Potatoes  | 1000kg
SunnyCorp  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne  | 2019/11/16 8:00  | Peaches  | 1000kg

When he/she unloads some products, the driver has a delivery slip signed. This delivery slip contains both the data and time of delivery and a list of the delivered products.

If a product that was ordered is missing, it will be delivered later.

All drivers have their own trucks. But, if the truck is currently under maintenance, a driver can be allowed to use a space truck.

# Step 1: modeling

1. Draw a logical model of the data (E/A).
2. Deduce a physical model of data

The physical model may be built with SQL Power Architect. See the related slides on *hippocampus*.

# Creating the database

For that part, we we are going to use pgAdmin like in the Trains database lab.

For this part, you have to create the SQL script for creating the database and the related tables. The SQL table creation script can be written by hand or exported from SQL Power Architect.

# Step 2: Populating the database

To actually use the database, we need data! Data can be entered either by SQL queries or by using pgAdmin interface. Provided data may impact several tables at a time. Enforcing integrity constraints is mandatory.

Add the following information to your database:

- Trucks
  - AC-543-AG
  - AD-671-TR
  - AH-126-GG
  - AM-654-TU
  - BA-865-PF
  - BA-921-AA (currently undergoing maintenance)
- Drivers
  - DENT Arthur using truck AC-543-AG
  - LE ROC'H Henry using truck BA-865-PF
  - DUPUIS Hervé using truck AH-126-GG
  - WEBER Jacques using truck BA-921-AA
- Loading docks
  - 5 allée Beltégueuse, Soumoulou
  - 15 rue des Rochers, Metz
  - 10 boulevard des marins, Nice
- Companies with their warehouses
  - Vegans Ltd, 12 boulevard Wezemir, Paris
    - 5 allée des rémouleurs, Pau
    - 25 impasse des tulipes, Bayonne
    - 2 rue des plantes, Marseille
    - 67 rue des 5 portes, Brest
  - Wizima, 1 cours Saint Pierre, Bordeaux
    - 8 rue des marchands, Tarbes
    - 1 rue de la braderie, Lille
    - 32 impasse des lumières, Lyon
  - SunnyCorp, 24 rue du pont, Angers
    - 14 rue de la tour, Narbonne
    - 7 impasse des 3 saules, Strasbourg

Then, add the following orders:

Company  |  Product | Quantity  | Delivery date  | Warehouse
--|---|---|---|--
Vegans Ltd  | Watermelon  |  300kg  | 2019/11/15 14:00  | 5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau
$\,$  | Potatoes  |  1000kg  |  2019/11/15 14:00 |  5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau
$\,$  | Strawberries  |  100kg  | 2019/11/15 16:30  | 8 rue des marchands, Bayonne
SunnyCorp | Peaches  | 1000kg | 2019/11/16 8:00  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne
$\,$  | Kiwis  | 100kg  | 2019/11/16 8:00  |  14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne
$\,$  | Potatotes  | 1000kg   | 2019/11/16 8:00  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne
Wizima  | Oranges  | 100kg  | 2019/11/22 15:00  |  32 impasse des lumières, Lyon
$\,$  | Leek | 200kg | 2019/11/22 15:00  |  32 impasse des lumières, Lyon

Then, add the following scheduled deliveries:

- Driver: DENT Arthur
- Loading dock: 5 allée Beltégueuse, Soumoulou, 2019/11/14 18:00

Company  | Warehouse  | Date  | Product | Quantity  
--|---|---|---|
Vegans Ltd  | 5 rue des rémouleurs, Pau  |  2019/11/15 14:00  |  Watermelons | 300kg
SunnyCorp  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne  | 2019/11/16 8:00  | Potatoes  | 1000kg
SunnyCorp  | 14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne  | 2019/11/16 8:00  | Peaches  | 1000kg

- Driver: LE ROC'H Henri
- Loading dock: 15 rue des Rochers, Metz, 2019/11/15 16:00

Company  | Warehouse  | Date  | Product | Quantity  
--|---|---|---|
SunnyCorp |  14 rue de la Tour, Narbonne | 2019/11/16 8:00 | Kiwis  | 100kg


To save a database with pgAdmin, right-click on the database name and select "Sauvegarder..."

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{pgadmin-save.pdf}
\end{center}

Then, select the filename, the saving format (use flat file) and the encoding (use utf-8). Next step consists in selecting the information to include. And the next one is the way to save data. The final step is used to select the schemas and tables to include in the backup.

If you use pgAdmin 4, use "Backup..." instead of "Sauvegarder...".

As you could guess, you will have to provide a backup of your database at the end of the lab.

# Step 3: Queries

Write and execute the following demands:

1. List the trucks of the company with their driver
2. List the deliveries that the truck AC-543-AG will do
3. List the spare trucks (i.e. the ones that do not have a driver)
4. List the orders for which there is no scheduled delivery so far
5. List the order for which there is a partial delivery scheduled
6. The driver LE ROC'H Henri has resigned.
7. Set up a mission order for driver Jacques WEBER for delivering the whole order of the Wizima company. The loading dock will be the Nice's one. He will load the products on delivery day at 7:00.


# End of lab

At this end of the lab (or a few hours/days later, to be determined in class), the following documents shall be submitted to guillaume.moreau@ec-nantes.fr:

- a PDF file with the queries and their result
- a database backup (the file must be zipped, no other compression scheme is allowed)
