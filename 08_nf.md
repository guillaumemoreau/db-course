### Introduction

- Goal of a logical schema: describe a database that will be actually:
  - used
  - loaded
  - accessed
  - updated
- Problem: how to ensure we are not introducing at design stage elements that will hinder those features?


### Updates

- Databases updates (inserts, removals or data change) must ensure database consistency
  - referential integrity
  - integrity constraints
  - dependencies between attributes
- Depending on the schema, it is more or less easy
  - the more redundancy, the more difficult...
