# Introduction to relational algebra

### Principle

Select the desired information, express them under the form of a relation obtained by successive applications of unary of binary operators whose operands are relations


### Motivation

- Why relational algebra?
  - mathematical foundations of the query language
  - basic principles of the queries
  - mathematically provable
  - useful for optimizing implementations

### Reminder

- An algebra is a set of operators, formally defined, that can be combined to build algebraic expressions
- Properties
  - Closure: the result of every operator is of the same type as the operands
  - (wished) Completeness: Every manipulation desired by the user should be expressed by an algebraic expression

### In our case

- Operands: relations of the relational model
- Closure: the result of every operation is a relation
- Completeness: allows every operation except transitive closure and aggregation functions

### Relations

- They are expressed as *Relation(Attribute1, Attribute2 ...)*
- They have an identifier

### 5 basic operators

- Selection ($\sigma$)
- Projection ($\pi$)
- cartesian product ($\times$)
- union ($\bigcup$)
- difference ($-$)

### and derived operators

- Renaming ($\alpha$)
- join ($\star$)
- intersection ($\bigcap$)
- division ($/$)

## Basic operators

### Selection (or restriction)

- Objective: restrict to some tuples in a relation

**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             UK            London          56             244
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41

We only want the countries which surface < 100: $SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$

### Selection (or restriction)

$SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$


**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             ~~UK~~        ~~London~~     ~~56~~             ~~\textcolor{red}{\textbf{244}}~~
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41


### Selection (or restriction)

- Syntax: $\sigma [c] R$ where
   - $c$: selection condition  
   - $R$: relation
- Elementary condition: *attribute comparison-operator constant-or-attribute*
   - *attribute* is an attribute of $R$
   - *comparison-operator* $\in$ $\{ =,\neq,<,>,\leq,\geq \}$
- Conditions may be elementary or composed (AND/OR) or negated
   - Parentheses may be used


### Examples

- $\sigma [Name=Capital] Country$: country which has the same name as its capital
- $\sigma [(Surface>100 AND Surface<500) AND (Population>30 AND Population<300)] Country$: country with surface between 100 and 500 and population between 30 and 300

### Selection (or restriction)

- Semantics: creates a new relation of schema $R$  with the set of tuples of $R$ that satisfy the condition
- Schema(result) = schema(operand)
- Population(result) $\leq$ population(operand)

### Projection

- Objective: restrict a relation to only some of its attributes

**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             UK            London          56             244
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41

- We only want the name and capital attributes: $Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$


### Projection

$Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$

**Capital**  Name          Capital   
-----------  ------------- ---------
             Austria       Vienna    
             UK            London    
             Switzerland   Bern      

### Projection

- Syntax: $\pi[attributes] R$
   - $attributes$ list of attributes to be kept
   - Semantics: creates a new relation with the set of tuples of $R$ but with only the attributes belonging to the *attributes* list
- Schema(result)  $\leq \pi$ schema (operand)
   - Population(result) $\leq$  Population(operand)
   - Why?

### Consequences on tuples

- If a projection does not keep the identifier of the relation, it may generate identical tuples
 - only the identifier is guaranteed for unicity
 - The result will only keep distinct tuples (closure)


### Cartesian product (or join)

- objective: build all possible tuple compilations from 2 relations
- binary operator, syntax: $R \times S$
- Semantics: every tuple of $R$ is combined with every tuple of $S$
- Schema: schema ($R \times S$) : schema($R$) $\times$ schema($S$)
- precondition: $R$ and $S$ do not have any common attribute
  - otherwise, renaming is mandatory *before* the product

### Union

- syntax: $R \cup S$
- semantics: gathers in a relation all tuples of $R$ and $S$
- precondition: $R$ and $S$ have the same schema!
- schema($R \cup S$) = schema($R$) = schema($S$)
- Side effect: double tuples may be created
   - they are automatically removed from the result

### Difference

- syntax: $R - S$
- semantics: selects tuples of $R$ that are not in $S$
- schema($R - S$) = schema($R$) = schema($S$)
- precondition: $R$ and $S$ have the same schema!

### Expression combination

 - We can look for the capitals of small countries
 - Remember
   - $SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$
   - $Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$
 - Then
   - $CapitalSmallCountry = \pi [Name,Capital] SmallCountry$
   - $CapitalSmallCountry = \pi [Name,Capital] \sigma[surface<100] Country$
 - Warning: combination is not commutative!
   - see data types...

## Other operators

### Renaming

- objective: solve compatibilities issues between attributes names for relations used in binary operators
- $\alpha$ operator is unary
- Example: $R_2 = \alpha [B \rightarrow C] R_1$
  - $B$ attribute of relation $R_1$ is renamed as $C$
- Semantics: All tuples of $R$ are kept with a new attribute name
- Schema is slightly modified
- precondition: the new attributes names were not pre-existing

### Complement

- objective: built all tuples combination that complement the tuples of $R$
- $\neg$ operator is unary
- syntax: $S = \neg R$  
- pre-condition: you have to work on finite domains to do that!
- schema: identical
- tuples: complement (all that are not in $R$)

### Example

### Natural join

- objective: create all **significant** combinations between the tuples of 2 relations
  - *significant*: have the same values for the attributes which have the same name
- precondition: both relation have at least one attribute with the same name
- syntax: $R \star S$ or $R \bowtie S$

\center\includegraphics[height=2cm]{fig/ra_naturaljoin.png}

### Example 1

\center\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/naturaljoin_ex1.png}

### Example 2

Couples are only built when it is possible

\center\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/naturaljoin_ex2.png}

### theta-join or outer join

- objective: create all significant combination between tuples of two relations
  - *significant*: according to a combination criterion which is explicitly defined as a parameter
- precondition: Both relation do not have attributes with common names
- Syntax: $R \star [ condition ] S$ or $R \bowtie[condition] S$
  - example: $R \star [ B \neq C] S$

\center\includegraphics[height=2.2cm]{fig/ra_thetajoin.png}

### theta-join or outer-join

- binary operator
- $c$: join condition
- elementary-condition:
  - attribute1 comparison-operator attribute2
  - attribute1 is a member of relation $R$
  - attribute2 is a member of relation $S$
  - comparison-operator: =,$\neq$,$<$,$>$,$\geq$,$\leq$
- condition:
  - elementary-condition
  - condition AND/OR condition
  - NOT condition
  - ( condition )

### Example

- Given the following relations
  - *Country(name,capital,population,surface,continent)*
  - *SpokenLanguage(language,country,%population)*
- Query: For every language, in which continent is it spoken?

. . .


\begin{exampleblock}{Answer}
\tiny $$\pi[language,continent](SpokenLanguage \bowtie [country = name]Country)$$
\end{exampleblock}

### Semi-join

- objective: same as join but only attributes of $R$ are kept
- syntax: $R \ltimes S$
- The resulting schema will be the schema of $R$

\center\includegraphics[height=2.2cm]{fig/leftsemijoin.png}

### Intersection

- syntax: $R \cap S$
- semantics: gathers in a relation tuples that belong to both  $R$ and $S$
- precondition: $R$ and $S$ have the same schema!

\center\includegraphics[width=5cm]{fig/intersection.pdf}

### Remark

- $R \cap S = R - (R - S)$

\center\includegraphics[width=7cm]{fig/inter-diff.pdf}

### Division

- objective: handle queries such  as " the ... such as ALL the ..."
- Let us consider $R(A_1,...A_n)$ and $V(A_1,...,A_m)$ with $n>m$ and $A_1,...,A_m$ attributes of same name in $R$ and $V$
- $R/V$ are the tuples from $R$ with the only attributes $A_{m+1},...,A_n$  which exist in $R$ appended with to all tuples of $V$
- $R/V = \{ <a_{m+1},...a_n> / \forall <a_1,...,a_n> \in V$, $\exists <a_1,...,a_m,a_{m+1},...,a_n> \in R\}$

### Properties of relational algebra

- Operator combination has properties which allow to:
  - implement queries
  - optimize queries
  - simplify queries
  - detect errors

### A few properties

- Joins, Unions and intersections are commutative
  - $R1 \times R2 = R2 \times R1$
- Joins, Unions, and intersections are associative
  - $(R1 \times R2) \times R3 = R1 \times (R2 \times R3)$
- Selection grouping
  - $\sigma[A2='b']\sigma[A1='a']$
  - $R1 = \sigma[(A2='b' and A1='a')] R1$

### Properties

- Combining selections and unions
  - $\sigma[A1='a'](R1 \cup R2) = (\sigma[A1='a']R1)\cup (\sigma[A1='a']R2)$
- Combining selections and projections
  - $\pi[A1...Ap]\sigma[Aj='a']R1$
    - $=\sigma[Aj='a']\pi[A1...Ap]R1$ if $Aj \in A1...Ap$
    - $=\pi[A1...Ap]\sigma[Aj='a']\pi[A1...Ap]R1$ if $Aj \notin A1...Ap$
  - Combining selections and joins
    - $\sigma[Ai='a' and Bj='b']R1 \times R2 = \sigma[Ai='a']R1 \times \sigma[Bj='b']R2$ with $Ai \in R1, Bj \in R2$

### Optimization

- The query optimizer uses the following principles
  - first, processes the selections and projections
  - then does the products, joins with minimum data
  - groups successive selections and projections
  - groups sequences of products or joins and projections

## Relational algebra and optimization
