# Functional modeling

## Before starting

- There exists several model types
  - Entity-Association model
  - UML model
  - SysML model
  - ...
- We cannot study all of them

# Entity-Association Model

## The Entity-Relationship model

- Was created around 1975
  - In France by Tardieu
  - In the US by Chen
- It integrates Merise (modelling method)

## The Entity-Relationship model

- Goal: allow the design/description of the conceptual structure of data for an application
- The base principals are equivalent to real-life abstraction concepts
  - object vs entity
  - link vs relationship
  - property vs attribute
  - representation of multiple links: link *is-a*

## The Entity-Relationship model

  Entity

  - Either a concrete or abstract  object
  - Exists as an instance of itself
  - Is of interest for the information system
  - Needs to be managed

## Entity

  - Entity: it represents an object of the real world having a life of its own
  - Entity Type: reprsentaion of a set of entities perceived as similar and having the same characteristics

## Entity: properties

  - Must define at least 1 characteristic of the entity that it depends on
  - It is needed for use in the information systems
  - Elementary data
  - It needs to be managed
  - Has a definite domain: {possible values}
  - Some properties may be impossible to define
  - Occurences
    - of properties
    - of entities

## Entity: properties

Properties: the characteristics of an entity

## The Entity-Relationship model

- Occurrence
  - a property
    - pair (property , its value)
  - an entity
    - pair (entity , { occurrences of properties } )
- Population { occurrences of entities}

## Example

Entity  |  Property |  Occurrences
--|---|--
Book  | Number  |  15
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  124
  $\,$ | Title  |  Relational Databases
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  The grapes of Wrath
  $\,$ | Author  |  Delobel
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  Steinbeck
  $\,$ | Year  | 1992
  $\,$ | $\,$   |  1939

## Representation

- Textual:
  - name_of_the_entity( list_of_properties )
    - where list_of_properties is a comma-seperated list of properties
- Graphically:

## Example

Book (Number, Title, Author, Year_Published)

## Entities versus occurrences

## Choosing the properties of an entity

- A property is directly linked to the entity it belongs to
- A property cannot evolve under the influence of time (i.e. choose birth date rather than age)
- Avoid property introducing information redundancy
