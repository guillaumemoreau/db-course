# The relational model

### What is it?

- The relational model: a formal model
  - relations, tuples, attributes, identifiers
  - relational algebra
  - relational computations
- Logical model but an implementation: SQL
  - table, column, line, primary key
  - Definition language
  - Manipulation language
  - Query language

### The relational model

  - History
    - Coming from the mathematical set theory
    - Introduced in 1970
      - Edgar Frank Codd, IBM Research Center, San José, CA
      - Got the Turing price in 1986
    - Developed by IBM Lab
    - As an improvement to relational algebra
  - Used today by most databases systems (Oracle, Informix, DB2, Ingres, Sybase)
  - 2 main concepts
    - Relations
    - Attributes (fields)

### Definitions

- An **attribute** is a *simple* and *mono-valued* element which is characteristic of a property
- A **relation** is a formal structure with a name and a list of attributes
  - *RelationName(Attribute1, Attribute2,...)*
- A **relational database** is a set of relations that model a problem

### Attributes

- An **attribute** is an information (a name)
- Examples
  - the name of a person
  - its height
  - the capacity of a hard disk
  - the size of a screen

### Domain

- The **domain** is the (finite or infinite) set of of values that an attribute may take
- Examples:
  - a person name: the set of strings
  - the size of a person: the set of real numbers (most probably we can be a bit more restrictive...)

### Remarks

- An attribute has a single value; it cannot contain multiple values
- Incorrect example:
  - Degree=\{Ingénieur Centrale Nantes, Master Computer Science Bordeaux, Phd Université Toulouse\}
  - The correct version will be seen later

### Schema

- A **relation** is a non empty set of attributes
- The **schema of a relation** is the list of attributes of a relation
- The **degree** of a relation is the number of its attributes
- The **schema of the relational database** is the set of the schemas of all the relations of the relational database

### Tuples

- A **tuple** or an **occurrence** of a relation is a set of consistent value of the attributes of the relation
- The **population** of a relation is the set of tuples of this relation
- The **cardinality** of a relation is the number of tuples it contains

### Tuples may be incomplete

### Incomplete tuples

- A tuple **cannot** have an empty attribute (i.e. an attribute without a value)
- Therefore a specific value is used:
  - no known value for this attribute
  - defined as **`NULL`**
- Remarks
  - **`NULL`** denotes an absence of information, which is a piece of information as is
  - **`NULL`** has no type and can thus replace an information of any kind
  - **`NULL`** is not a value and must be therefore carefully manipulated

### Corrected example with unknown data

### Identifier


- The **identifier** of a relation is the minimum set of attributes of a relation such that there never exists two tuples with the same values for those attributes
- Remarks:
  - Any relation **must** have an identifier
  - A relation may have several potential identifiers. Only one (the most appropriate) will be used
  - The identifier of a relation is denoted by underlining the attributes composing it
  - The identifier cannot have an attribute that may contain a null value
    - i.e. all data must be known for the attributes of the identifier
  - A relation cannot have 2 tuples for which the identifiers have the same value

### Example

*Student(LastName, FirstName, \underline{StudentId}, Birthdate)*

### Why do we need an identifier?

### External link and external identifier

- An **external link** between two relations is the oriented symbolic link between two sets of attributes of same nature in both relations
- An **external identifier** of a relation is a set of attributes matching an identifier of a (other) relation in the relational database
- Remark
  - The external identifier is denoted by an arrow starting from the set of attributes of the starting relation and ending with the arrival relation

### Example

  \center\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/externalid.png}

- There exists an external link between *Follows*'s *StudentId* and the identifier of *Student*
- There exists an external link between *Follows*'s *CourseNumber* and the identifier of *Course*

### Example

### Consequence of referential integrity

- It is impossible to add a tuple in the first relation if there is no matching tuple in the second relation
- It is impossible to remove a tuple of the second relation if it is linked to a tuple in the first one
- It is impossible to update a tuple of the second relation if is is linked to a tuple of the first one and if the update makes it have a non-existent value in the first relation
