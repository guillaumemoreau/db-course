# Introduction to relational algebra

## Principle

Select the desired information, express them under the form of a relation obtained by successive applications of unary of binary operators whose operands are relations

## Motivation

- Why relational algebra?
  - mathematical foundations of the query language
  - basic principles of the queries
  - mathematically provable
  - useful for optimizing implementations

## Reminder

- An algebra is a set of operators, formally defined, that can be combined to build algebraic expressions
- Properties
  - Closure: the result of every operator is of the same type as the operands
  - (wished) Completeness: Every manipulation desired by the user should be expressed by an algebraic expression

## In our case

- Operands: relations of the relational model
- Closure: the result of every operation is a relation
- Completeness: allows every operation except transitive closure and aggregation functions

## Relations

- They are expressed as *Relation(Attribute1, Attribute2 ...)*
- They have an identifier

## 5 basic operators

- Selection ($\sigma$)
- Projection ($\pi$)
- cartesian product ($\times$)
- union ($\bigcup$)
- difference ($-$)

## and derived operators

- Renaming ($\alpha$)
- join ($\star$)
- intersection ($\bigcap$)
- division ($/$)

# Basic operators

## Selection (or restriction)

- Objective: restrict to some tuples in a relation

**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             UK            London          56             244
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41

We only want the countries which surface < 100: $SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$

## Selection (or restriction)

$SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$


**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             ~~UK~~        ~~London~~     ~~56~~             ~~\textcolor{red}{\textbf{244}}~~
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41


## Selection (or restriction)

- Syntax: $\sigma [c] R$ where
   - $c$: selection condition  
   - $R$: relation
- Elementary condition: *attribute comparison-operator constant-or-attribute*
   - *attribute* is an attribute of $R$
   - *comparison-operator* $\in$ $=,\neq,<,>,\leq,\geq$
- Conditions may be elementary or composed (AND/OR) or negated
   - Parentheses may be used


## Examples

- $\sigma [Name=Capital] Country$: country which has the same name as its capital
- $\sigma [(Surface>100 AND Surface<500) OR (Population>30 AND Population<300)] Country$: country with surface between 100 and 500 and population between 30 and 300

## Selection (or restriction)

- Semantics: creates a new relation of schema $R$  with the set of tuples of $R$ that satisfy the condition
- Schema(result) = schema(operand)
- Population(result) $\leq$ population(operand)

## Projection

- Objective: restrict a relation to only some of its attributes

**Country**  Name          Capital       Population     Surface
-----------  ------------- ---------   ------------   ---------
             Austria       Vienna          8               83
             UK            London          56             244
             Switzerland   Bern            7                41

- We only want the name and capital attributes: $Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$


## Projection

$Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$

**Capital**  Name          Capital   
-----------  ------------- ---------
             Austria       Vienna    
             UK            London    
             Switzerland   Bern      

## Projection

- Syntax: $\pi[attributes] R$
   - $attributes$ list of attributes to be kept
   - Semantics: creates a new relation with the set of tuples of $R$ but with only the attributes belonging to the *attributes* list
- Schema(result)  $\leq \pi$ schema (operand)
   - Population(result) $\leq$  Population(operand)
   - Why?

## Consequences on tuples

- If a projection does not keep the identifier of the relation, it may generate identical tuples
 - only the identifier is guaranteed for unicity
 - The result will only keep distinct tuples (closure)

## Expression combination

 - We can look for the capitals of small countries
 - Remember
   - $SmallCountry = \sigma[surface<100] Country$
   - $Capital = \pi[Name,Capital] Country$
 - Then
   - $CapitalSmallCountry = \pi [Name,Capital] SmallCountry$
   - $CapitalSmallCountry = \pi [Name,Capital] \sigma[surface<100] Country$
 - Warning: combination is not commutative!
   - see data types...
