# The Entity-Association model at work

## Conceptual models

- Entity types
- Mapping types
- Attributes
- Identifiers
- Domains for simple attributes
- Integrity constraints

## Entity types

- Name of the entity type
- Name of the potential *up*-types
- Free definition (comment) providing the semantics of the entity type
- Exact definition of the population related to an entity type
- Description of the attributes
- **\color{red}Define the identifier(s)**
- Composition of the identifiers of the entity type (if any)
- Integrity Constraints related to the Entity Type

## Mapping types

- Name of the mapping type
- Free definition (comment) providing the semantics of the mapping type
- Names of the entity types participating in the mapping type with the name of their role in the mapping
  - For each role, its cardinality
- Description of the attributes (if any)
- Composition of the identifiers of the mapping type (if any)
- Integrity constraints related to the mapping type

## Example problem

> A rental store has several device types for rent. Devices as well
> their type are designated by a number and have a label. Every device type
> has a rental rate. Devices may be rented by customers, identified by a number
> and whose name and address are known. A customer may rent several devices.
> The same device may be rented several times by the same customer, therefore
> the rent start date and duration are stored. Customers who have forgotten
> to give back their devices will be contacted and billed.

## Example
- Customer Rental Balance
  - Customer Number: 1235
  - Name: John DOE
  - Address: Nantes

DeviceId  | M10  | M10  | M05
--|---|---|--
Name  | Camera  | Camera  | Hifi
TypeId  | T3  | T3  | T7  
TypeName  | Video  | Video  |  Sound
Fee  | 20  | 20  | 150
StartDate  | 2018-12-01  | 2018-03-02  |  2008-03-02
ReturnDate  |  2019-01-04  | $\,$  |  $\,$

## STEP 1: determine the set of properties

- 2 lists should established:
  - the list of required information
  - for each information, the list of characteristic properties. One of these properties (or a set of them) will have to uniquely identify the information

## Example STEP 1

- List of required information
  - The customer
  - The device and its type
  - The rental

## Example STEP 1

- List of required information
  - The customer
    - The name of the customer: *CustomerName*
    - The address of the customer: *CustomerAddress*
    - Not enough to uniquely identify the customer, so we add a client number: *CustomerId*
  -  The device and its type
    - The rental

## Example STEP 1

- List of required information
  - The customer
  - The device and its type
    - The device has a name: *DeviceName*
    - The device has a type: *Type*
    - The device has a rental fee: *Fee*
    - Not enough to uniquely identify the device, se we add a device number: *DeviceId*
  - The rental

## Example STEP 1

- List of required information
  - The customer
  - The device and its type
  - The rental
    - The person who rents (\textcolor{magenta}{the client})
    - The device that is rented (\textcolor{magenta}{the device})
    - the rental start date: *StartDate*
    - the rental return date: *ReturnDate*
    - we consider that knowing the customer, the rented device and the rental dates, we have enough information

## Step 1: list of properties

- *CustomerName*
- *CustomerAddress*
- *CustomerId*
- *DeviceName*
- *Type*
- *Fee*
- *DeviceId*
- *StartDate*
- *ReturnDate*

## Caution

- It is a good idea to avoid properties that would have the same name...
- A naming convention can be adopted
  - a suffix or prefix can be added
  - for example: the name of the information on which is depends

## Step 2: looking for functional dependencies

From the list of properties, functional dependencies can be established

- $CustomerId \rightarrow CustomerName$
- $CustomerId \rightarrow CustomerAddress$
- $DeviceId \rightarrow DeviceName$
- $DeviceId \rightarrow Type$
- $Type \rightarrow Fee$ (an approximation here!)
- $CustomerId,DeviceId,StartDate \rightarrow ReturnDate$

## Step 2: looking for functional dependencies

Functional dependencies are not always sufficient to completely build the problem. For each information, we will add the set of elements that are necessary to define it:

- $CustomerId$: the client
- $DeviceId$: the device and its type
- $(CustomerId,DeviceId,StartDate)$: the rental

## Step 2: looking for functional dependencies

- $CustomerId$: the client
- $DeviceId$: the device and its type
- $(\textcolor{magenta}{the client},\textcolor{magenta}{the device},StartDate)$: the rental

\begin{exampleblock}{Remark}
Some elements on the left part of the list are information by themselves. They are replaced by the element that allows to uniquely define them. This element \textbf{must} be composed of a single property. If it is not the case, a new property is added to uniquely define the set of properties used as an identifier. New functional dependencies are then added.
\end{exampleblock}

## Multiple properties as identifiers

- Example
  - $InfoId1$ for information 1
  - $InfoId2$ for information 2
  - (\textcolor{magenta}{information 1},\textcolor{magenta}{information 2}) for information 3
  - $(InfoId4,\textcolor{magenta}{information 3}) for information 4

## Multiple properties as identifiers

- After substitution
  - $InfoId1$ for information 1
  - $InfoId2$ for information 2
  - (\textcolor{red}{InfoId1},\textcolor{red}{InfoId2}) for information 3
  - $(InfoId4,\textcolor{magenta}{information 3}) for information 4

No substitution can be made in the last line

## Multiple properties as identifiers

- We add an information
  - \textcolor{red}{InfoId3=(InfoId1,InfoId2)}
- We add functional dependencies
  - $InfoId3 \rightarrow InfoId1$
  - $InfoId3 \rightarrow InfoId2$
- and the last line becomes
  - $(InfoId4,\textcolor{red}{InfoId3}) for information 4

## Dependency Graph

## Step 4: Building the entities

- Determine the sources of the functional dependencies
  - $A = \{ properties p / p in FD source \} $
- Build an entity from each of those properties. The property is the identifier of the entity

## Step 4: Building the entities

Sources are marked in magenta. 4 are identified: $A=\{ CustomerId, DeviceId, StartDate, Type \}$

## Step 4: Building the entities

$A=\{ CustomerId, DeviceId, StartDate, Type \}$


\center\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/ea-modeling-3.pdf}

## Step 5: Building the mappings

- A source FD vertex defines a mapping type is it is composed of at least two elements of $A$ that are the identifiers of entity types involved in the mapping type. The maximum cardinalities are then $n$
- Two FD source edges linked by a FD define a mapping type of dimension 2. One of the cardinality is equal to $(0,1)$ or $(1,1)$

## Step 5: Building the mappings

*A source FD vertex defines a mapping type is it is composed of at least two elements of $A$ that are the identifiers of entity types involved in the mapping type. The maximum cardinalities are then $n$*

## Step 5: Building the mappings

*Two FD source edges linked by a FD define a mapping type of dimension 2. One of the cardinality is equal to $(0,1)$ or $(1,1)$*

## Step 6: Add remaining properties

- Add the properties that are not into $A$ to the entities that are sources of functional dependencies

## Step 6: Add remaining properties (entities)

## Step 6: Add remaining properties (mappings)

## Summary

## Step 7: Check

- Check that every information that you have identified is represented. Those that are not are mappings
- The Customer: the Customer entity
- The device and its type: the mapping between the device and its type
- The rental: the mapping between the customer, the device and the rental start date

## Remarks

- This method does not work for every single case (choosing the primary keys)
- The obtained schema may not represent reality as intuitively as other schemas
- Some steps may be interactive (useful if the graph of FD is not exact)
- The schema should be validated, which may drive to use other concepts of the E-A model
- This method is useful for small sized-problems
